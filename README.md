To run the program:
Compile with "javac searchEngine.java" 
then "java searchEngine"


**Once you submit a query, please extend the gui so you can see the results**

Queries folder holds all 200 queries in alphabetical order, with the name of the file being the website name. 
stopWords folder holds the stopWord file.

//in the gui:
you can only click on the stopWords folder, which contains a stopword list .
you can only click on a folder for queries.
//


//
in order for the program to progress, I have done added some checks:
is a corpus loaded?
are the stop words loaded?
have you chosen a location for the output and a name?
