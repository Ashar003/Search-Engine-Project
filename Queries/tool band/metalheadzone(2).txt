Back on November 13, Tool frontman Maynard talked with Gourmet Traveller Wine and revealed the true reason why he moved to Arizona.

Here’s what he said:

“I didn’t move to Arizona to make wine. I moved to just get out of LA. I’m from a small town in Michigan, so I moved to a small town in Arizona, which is close enough to LA to get back and do work but there’s more fresh air here, and a lot more views.”
