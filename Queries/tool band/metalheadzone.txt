According to recent report from Reddit, an user named SonicTitan81 has revealed what he noticed at the Tool show and told his experience and struggles that he faced with that a drug user while listening to the band. Also, the drug user sitting motionless, despite Tool’s enthusiastic songs.

He also shared the details of how security came towards him and his girlfriend when he went to the kid to check that he was okay. The security then reached the scene and threw the acid-drinking audience out of the concert.

Here’s what the user named SonicTitan81 wrote on Reddit:

“Something very odd that has never happened to me at a Tool show or any concert for that matter happened last Sunday. Me and my girlfriend had really amazing floor seats up front for Tool which I was able to get day they went on sale. Every other show we have been in the stands so this was a big deal to us both. We are both big fans, especially me, since my first show in 2001. We both are very chill people who get along with anyone and never have problems with people.

SonicTitan81 continued the story:

So…. we get to our seats about 10 minutes till they take the stage and notice a kid in front of me, face in hands sitting motionless. I know he’s fucked up but no big deal. First song plays, kid is still sitting motionless. Second song hit, and its Aenema, more of a hype song. The kid proceeds to STAND on his chair, turn around and directly infant of me leans into me dick level to my face and starts screaming for at least 3 minutes not turning around or standing down. His buddy and me are trying to get him to turn around and act civil before security yank him out.

I WANT him to have fun and rage but just not on a chair turned around and facing me. The kid doesn’t take to me asking him to stop nicely. He gets very aggressive looking balling fists up and staring at me and my girl. I was determined to not allow this to ruin my experience but he would not stop, only getting worse. So I did what I had to do before this guy threw a punch, I grabbed security and had him pulled. I felt awful and so did his friends.

They even said they were sorry and tried to buy me a drink. I dont feel bad anymore as I honestly believe I did the right thing in the moment. If he would have thrown punches we BOTH would have been pulled. Moral of the story, if you are gonna buy floor ticket, dont eat so much acid you cant control yourself. You dumb fucker.”
