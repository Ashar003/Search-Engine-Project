WATCH MAYNARD JAMES KEENAN’S OLD BAND PERFORM ON PUBLIC ACCESS TV IN THE ’80S

Before he was the singer of Tool, Puscifer and A Perfect Circle, or the Southwestern winemaster known for Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars, Maynard James Keenan performed in a couple of other bands. Notably, he fronted the group C.A.D. in the late '80s, of which prime video footage exists.

And talk about a blast from the past. As seen in the below video, Keenan runs through a full set of punk-funk fusion with C.A.D. in a public access TV performance dating from 1987; all while decked out in a black tank top and some elegant sandals. Watch the complete show down toward the bottom of this post.

-ADVERTISEMENT-




C.A.D. is short for Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty, the full name of the band from Keenan's college-age base in Grand Rapids, Michigan. As pointed out on Reddit, an early version of Tool's "Sober" can be found among the act's repertoire.

As diehard Tool fans are likely aware, Keenan wrote the song a few years before he joined up with future bandmates Adam Jones, Danny Carey and Paul D'Amour — the latter eventually replaced by Justin Chancellor — 2,000 miles away in Los Angeles.

The C.A.D. video comes courtesy of GRTV, Grand Rapid's public access station, which uploaded the vintage footage earlier this year. "Maynard James Keenan in the 80's," the video's YouTube description reads. "Performing with C.A.D. (Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty). Live on GRTV Public Access Television Grand Rapids. Part of the Peace Day live broadcast marathon in 1987."

Of course, these days, Keenan is keeping busy with Tool, among his other pursuits. Tool's first new album in 13 years, Fear Inoculum, came out in August. (An expanded book edition arrives Dec. 13.) The band is on tour behind the effort through next year. Get Tool concert tickets here.

Zoo Entertainment

44. "The Gaping Lotus Experience" - 'Opiate' (1992)
The hidden track on ‘Opiate’ was Tool’s first foray into psych rock. Before they found their musical identity, which is trippy in its own unique way, they wrote this 2-and-a-half minute jammer that caps off their debut EP. The song is reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix and other psychedelic influencers of the 1960s/70s. The song isn’t inherently bad, it just is a very generic take on what has already been done, making it forgettable. Thankfully, Tool evolved rather quickly. By the time they released their first full-length album in 1993, they had defined their mind-bending sound that we have come to know and love. — Katy Irizarry
Zoo Entertainment

43. "Disgustipated" - 'Undertow' (1993)
Over 15 minutes of religious satire and eerie ambiance, the track might actually be the longest in Tool’s discography if you include the crickets and phone message following the rhythm-driven track. Though it doesn’t possess much musically, it proved to be the perfect closing to Tool’s debut album. It’s disturbing, primal and a track meant to evoke a mood more than anything else. Why else would Maynard fire a round of bullets into a piano for the track? Fun Fact: The story told at the end of this song was a message from Maynard’s landlord originally left on his answering machine—find proof in the credits. — Rae Lemeshow-Barooshian
Volcano Entertainment

42. "Maynard's Dick" - 'Salival' (2000)
If there was ever any clear evidence that Tool was a product of the ’90s, it’s “Maynard’s Dick,” the grungy, satirical hidden track on the band’s ‘Salival’ collection. The song sounds less like Tool and more like Nirvana with a Tool guest appearance, which is likely why it served only as a bonus track on a special edition disc rather than a song on one of their full-lengths. While the song might showcase a different side of Tool musically, it’s most certainly an accurate display of Maynard’s sense of gallows humor. — KI
Volcano Entertainment

41. "Triad" - 'Lateralus' (2001)
‘Lateralus’ is Tool’s ‘Dark Side of the Moon.’ It’s an epic and conceptual opus that captivates the listener from start to finish, reigning as their greatest album among several other nearly perfect bodies of work. This instrumental from Tool brings ‘Lateralus’ to an epic conclusion. WIthout a shred of lyrics, the music speaks for itself and still manages to stay on brand with a very intense and trippy vibe. The song almost seamlessly begins as “Reflection” concludes, leaving many to believe that the last three tracks on the album are meant to be delivered as a “triad,” much like the way Pink Floyd concludes ‘Dark Side.’ — KI
Volcano Entertainment

40. "Disposition" - 'Lateralus' (2001)
A simple track driven by deeply resonating riffs and brilliantly ambient drumming, it’s not one without purpose. With only three lines of repeated lyrical content, “Mention this to me / Mention something, mention anything / Watch the weather change,” “Disposition” still manages to be as striking as Tool’s heavier, more fleshed out tracks. It’s about embracing change, as confusing as it may be. — RL-B
Volcano Entertainment

39. "Intension" - '10,000 Days' (2006)
‘10,000 Days’ really saw a sonic shift from the band. As previously mentioned, they slowed things down a lot more than usual, delivering a calm and meditative energy. “Intension” is by far the most meditative track of Tool’s to date. It’s smooth, minimalistic and quite frankly, it meanders a bit and isn’t very attention grabbing. Despite the song’s flaws, the band still puts forth a solid display of musicianship. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

38. "Crawl Away" - 'Undertow' (1993)
“Crawl Away” is one of the heavier jams from Tool. It’s got a crunchy, beefy edge to it, straying away from their usually progressive and technical vibe. Even during the bridge, it gets speedy and rough, making it one of the few tracks that can easily be defined as “metal.” This might not seem significant, but if you know Tool, you know their sound can’t be pinpointed or put into a generic box, which is what makes “Crawl Away” stand out. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

37. "Cold and Ugly" - 'Opiate' (1992)
“Cold and Ugly” is a feel good rock ’n’ roll song about feeling bad. While lyrically, the song is about a woman who shuts people out to protect herself from getting hurt, the music is high energy, hard and relatively upbeat—at least by Tool’s standards. And if this song isn’t something you can relate to on some level, then you’ve never been dead inside and it shows. — KI
Volcano Entertainment

36. "Merkaba" - 'Salival' (2000)
Tool isn’t typically considered a jam band, but they aren’t really far off if you think about it. This rough cut from the band’s first EP is as “jam band” as it gets, delivering a vibe that’s wrapped in improvisation and 1970s drug culture. The song is a noisy and trippy vortex of “some kind of psychedelic experience,” serving up a more candid side of the band. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

35. "Part of Me" - 'Opiate' (1992)
The meaning of this track could easily be one of two things: selfishly considering someone to be an extension of one’s self thanks to a sense of an entitlement, or, Maynard’s penis. No matter the case, it’s still so satisfying to yell “You are just a part of me!” whenever the track comes on—it’s a feel-good riot of a song that drives you to and off the edge. — R-LB
Zoo Entertainment

34. "Swamp Song" - 'Undertow' (1993)
Sexy, addictive and with one hell of bassline, “Swamp Song” sounds like trekking through mud—in the best of dirty ways. The way the song builds as it layers moody riffs and emotive vocals is absolutely brilliant. By the time you reach the halfway mark of the 5 minute track, the explosive release of heavier riffs and unadulterated aggression the band has worked up is euphoric. — RL-B
Volcano Entertainment

33. "Reflection" - 'Lateralus' (2001)
In keeping up with ‘Lateralus’’ themes of enlightenment “Reflection” is one of the more ritualistic tracks from the band. The composition has a primitive yet modern feel to it, providing an organic soundscape for your next Ayahuasca trip. The magic of this song is that you can listen to it while stone cold sober and still use it as a vessel that will make you feel spiritually connected to something deeper. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

32. "4°" - 'Undertow' (1993)
“4°” opens up with a spacey effervescence that takes the listener back to the ’70s. It then kicks into a crunchy and anthemic rock song that really showcases Maynard’s vocal range. The song is one of their earlier explorations of enlightenment, encouraging the listener to step outside the norm and “free yourself from yourself.” — KI
Volcano Entertainment

31. "Rosetta Stoned" - '10,000 Days' (2006)
If anything, this track is a testament to Drummer Danny Carey’s skill as he quickly shifts between 4/4, 5/8, 5/4, 11/8, 3/4, and 6/4 time signatures to drive the band through this otherworldly track. Telling the story of a man who is hospitalized drugged-out alien encounter in Area 51, this track doesn’t hold any punches after its more mellow introduction. Heavy riffs drive the track as Maynard rambles off the man’s story—it’s disorienting but totally epic. — RL-B
Zoo Entertainment

30. "Flood" - 'Undertow' (1993)
Heavy as all hell with sludge drenched feel, as soon as you hear the first few riffs of “Flood,” you know you’re in for something intense. Though by no means explicit, the track definitely comes off as one grappling with a loss of faith and a scrambling for a new reality as the waters of truth rise up. The track has the chaotic energy of a man whose world is crumbling around him, and it’s that same intense disorder that makes the track all the more addictive. — RL-B
Zoo Entertainment

29. "Hush" - 'Opiate' (1992)
“I can’t say what I want to / Even if I’m not serious.” Damn, Maynard, did you predict the rise of outrage culture? Behind a Paul D’Amour funk bass line, Keenan defends his own free speech while decimating an unknown contrarian, lambasting them with “fuck yourself” and “kill yourself.” It’s one of Maynard’s essential “people person” anthems. — Graham Hartman
Volcano Entertainment

28. "The Patient" - 'Lateralus' (2001)
“The Patient” strays away from the spirit quest concepts of ‘Lateralus.’ Instead, it takes on a much more serious and powerful shape as it’s one of Maynard’s earlier odes to his mother. The song explores how his mother has held on for so long after her tragedy, speculating that the reason why she kept fighting, despite her constant pain, was because of the love that surrounded her. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

27. "Undertow" - 'Undertow' (1993)
Perfectly representing a fight with a seemingly unstoppable force, there have been many interpretations of the track’s struggle-fueled lyrics—the most popular being the trials of addiction. Considering the lyrical narrative of resisting a voice of temptation, the shifts from slow-tempo longing to brash riffs of betrayal and eventual cries of hopelessness following euphoria—the call is yours to make. Regardless, the track is epic for its intense mood swings, riffs and visceral metaphors. — RL-B
Zoo Entertainment

26. "Jerk-Off" - 'Opiate' (1992)
“Jerk-Off” is perhaps one of the earliest examples of Tool working out their now-signature sound. ‘Opiate’ isn’t really a cohesive body of work as much as it’s a collection of different expressions from the band. However, “Jerk-Off” stands apart from the rest, showcasing the band’s experimental abilities and offering an early blueprint of where they were headed. If you could get past the rough production factor, which is one of the facets that gives ‘Opiate’ its charm, this song is actually a pretty tight cut from the vault. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

25. "Sweat" - 'Opiate' (1992)
“Sweat” is one of the tracks that perfectly represents all that Tool set out to accomplish as a band. The lyrics on this track are outstanding—beautifully poetic, yet nonsensical enough to be left to wide interpretation. Meanwhile, the riffs and drumming on this track absolutely rock. It’s an intense track that fundamentally showcases how Tool has just always been THAT good. — RL-B
Zoo Entertainment

24. "Bottom" - 'Undertow' (1993)
“Bottom” has to be one of Adam Jones’ most underrated riffs. Jones’ relentless strumming creates the song’s headwind, while vocal parts from both Maynard Keenan and Henry Rollins examine self-hatred, guilt, fear and self-preservation. — GH
Volcano Entertainment

23. "The Pot" - '10,000 Days' (2006)
Shit-talkers beware, Tool are calling your kettle black in the 2006 song “The Pot.” The second single from the ‘10,000 Days’ album finds Maynard James Keenan with an almost feminine vocal delivering the warning, “Who are you to wave your finger / You must have been out your head.” The band offers their statement on hypocrisy using vivid imagery, speaking about tossing stones around in a “soapbox house of cards and glass.” The band’s first-ever Mainstream Rock chart-topper went on to receive a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. — Chad Childers
Zoo Entertainment

22. "Intolerance" - 'Undertow' (1993)
The first track on Tool’s debut album offers killer riffs that guide you into one hell of an addictive song. Alluding to Maynard’s time in the military—with the lyrics “You lie, cheat, and steal” reflecting that of West Point’s Honor Code, “A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do”— the track is a fundamental rejection of hypocrisy in all of its forms—and it goes hard. — RL-B
Zoo Entertainment

21. "Hooker With a Penis" - 'Ænima' (1996)
You know how it goes the second a band who is perceived to be “underground” gets a shred of success. Suddenly, they’re “sell-outs” because the KVLT elitists of the world can’t seem to handle it when something that they love is so good that it gets radio airplay. “Hooker With A Penis” is Maynard’s rebuttal to the naysayers, clapping back hard with the kind of sharp-tongued panache that skewers the trolls in one deadly strike. — KI
Volcano Entertainment

20. "Ticks & Leeches" - 'Lateralus' (2001)
A song about parasites? It’s rare that such a track isn’t about either ex-lovers, friends or record label executives. No matter who is sucking away, the ever aggressive track punctuated with screams and distorted guitars accomplishes its goal of making sure they can feel the rage directed toward them. This is a song built off of anger, and it effectively spits that feeling right back out as every scream of “I hope you choke” conjures the image of someone parasitic in our own lives. — RL-B
Zoo Entertainment

19. "H." - 'Ænima' (1996)
“H.’s” core theme is largely debated. Is it about Maynard’s son? Is it about drug addiction? Is it about people who suck? One of Tool’s most intriguing (and sometimes frustrating) elements is the mystery they’ve shrouded themselves in. Musically, the song is a climbing composition that slowly grows in intensity with each shift, eventually culminating in an epic cacophony only to come back down again, rounding the song out. — KI
Volcano Entertainment

18. "Right in Two" - '10,000 Days' (2006)
“Right in Two” is one of Tool’s more somber bodies of work. The song is ambient and brooding, exuding an aura of dark melancholia. The most noteworthy aspect of this 8-and-a-half minute opus is by far Danny Carey’s percussion work. The drums are simple, yet as prominent as ever, coming right to the foreground and serving up more than a simple rhythm. During the song’s reprisal, Carey is given the spotlight, delivering an intensely intricate drum break that is sure to mesmerize the listener. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

17. "Prison Sex" - 'Undertow' (1993)
The second single from Tool’s ‘Undertow’ debut, “Prison Sex” utilizes Drop-B tuning while accentuating the bass play and rhythmic chaos of original bassist Paul D’Amour and drummer Danny Carey. Thematically, the band tackles the cycle of abuse with guitarist Adam Jones also helping to create a controversial video for the song that addressed the subject matter. Maynard James Keenan gets a vitriolic release at points, but showcases nuanced vulnerability vocally while coming to terms with the realization of the situation. — CC
Zoo Entertainment

16. "Jimmy" - 'Ænima' (1996)
Inspired by his mother’s paralyzing cerebral aneurysm that occurred when Maynard “Jimmy” Keenan was only 11, the track is undoubtedly haunting. As Maynard grapples with how his life changed at 11, presumably talking to his younger self, the riffs on the track perfectly portray a sense of both frustration and sorrow. Without a doubt, “Jimmy” is a mesmerizing track that not only sends shivers down the spine, but is so brilliantly self-reflective that it’s one of Ænima’s best. — RL-B
Zoo Entertainment

15. "Stinkfist" - 'Ænima' (1996)
This controversial cut from ‘Ænima’ found itself censored and renamed “Track #1” by MTV when it made its debut. Superficially, the song is about the sexual act of fisting, something Maynard certainly used to shock and mock the masses. However, Maynard isn’t one to typically be so straightforward with his themes. One could interpret “Stinkfist” to be a metaphor for an individual who suffers from ennui, feeling numb and desensitized, struggling to feel pain and satisfaction, but finding themselves constantly needing more to “breathe, to feel, to know [they’re] alive.” Or maybe it’s about someone who really enjoys being fist fucked. Either way, we’re not here to judge anything beyond the quality of the music and on that front, this song is one of the most solid offerings in Tool’s catalog. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

14. "Opiate" - 'Opiate' (1992)
German philosopher Karl Marx once famously stated that “Religion is opium for the masses.” Tool applies this wisdom to the title track from their first EP, and they get real Jim Jones-y with it. The lyrics paint religion as a cult, mocking those who blindly believe that if they follow the leader, they will “get [their] soul to heaven.” It isn’t solely a take on the corrupt flaws of theism and cult culture, but it’s also an ode to freethinkers, championing those who ask questions and can separate themselves from the pack. — KI
Volcano Entertainment

13. "The Grudge" - 'Lateralus' (2001)
Opening ‘Lateralus’ (every Tool fan’s personal guide to navigating the pitfalls of life) “The Grudge” is a lesson on letting go. It also celebrates attaining a level of wisdom, characterized by Saturn’s transition around the Sun, which takes 29.5 years to complete. — GH
Volcano Entertainment

12. "Jambi" - '10,000 Days' (2006)
When you think of Tool, you probably don’t associate them with Pee-Wee Herman. Meanwhile, “Jambi” was named after the magic genie who granted wishes on ‘Pee-Wee’s Playhouse.’ Despite the seemingly light and playful namesake of this track from ‘10,000 Days,’ the lyrical content is dark and heartbreaking. Maynard laments about the passing of his mother, bargaining with “Jambi” to have just one more day with his mother and in exchange, he’d “give it all away.” — KI
Volcano Entertainment

11. "Schism" - 'Lateralus' (2001)
The first single from Tool’s third album, Lateralus, this Grammy-winning track has one of the best basslines of their discography. If the before mentioned wasn’t enough to justify “Schism”’s place at No. 11, just try and get these riffs out of your head following a listen — or better yet, attempt to find a better vocal performance from Maynard ranked below this track. — RL-B
Zoo Entertainment

10. "Sober" - 'Undertow' (1993)
A friend of the band inspired this alt-metal classic. Struggling with substance abuse, this person could only feel creative while under the influence — “Why can’t we drink forever?” “Sober” is one of Tool’s simplest tracks, but it’s also one of Maynard Keenan’s most emotionally crushing vocal deliveries. — GH
Volcano Entertainment

9. "Vicarious" - '10,000 Days' (2006)
The social commentary is on full blast here, as Maynard James Keenan addresses the increasing nature of television viewers feeding off sensationalistic content. “I need to watch things die from a good safe distance,” Keenan sings with his hypnotically dark and sinister vocal, later concluding the biting track with the line, “I live while the whole world dies / Much better you than I.” This vibrantly pulsing first single from the ‘10,000 Days’ album would climb to No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock chart and would earn the band a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance. — CC
Zoo Entertainment

8. "Forty Six & 2" - 'Ænima' (1996)
Along with enlightenment and free-thinking, numerical significance is one of the many hallmarks of Tool. “Forty-Six & 2” is all of those things as it references philosopher Carl Jung’s theory that humans can evolve to eventually develop 48 chromosomes, which is two more than our typical 46. The idea is that we will reach our full biological potential once that evolution is achieved. Additionally, the song also makes references to one’s shadow, which is another philosophy of Jung’s. Jung believes that the “shadow” of one’s personality is a part of us that we do not consciously recognize. It could be negative traits that we refuse to acknowledge or it could be positive qualities that we fail to notice. In “Forty-Six & 2,” Maynard’s shadow seems to be his dark passenger, which harbors his “insecure delusions” that are holding him back from his metamorphosis. — KI
Volcano Entertainment

7. "Wings for Marie (Pt 1)" / "10,000 Days (Pt 2)" - '10,000 Days' (2006)
The title for ‘10,000 Days’ was inspired by the tragedy of Maynard’s mother, who was left paralyzed by a cerebral aneurysm when Maynard was only 11 years old. The number 10,000 denotes an approximation of the time between the life-changing event in 1976 and her death in 2003. Maynard worked through his grief throughout album, paying homage to his mother with these two deep and intense tracks, which both have an ambient and ethereal aura that contrasts Tool’s usually high energy sound. Despite slowing things down a bit, these songs still deliver a sonic assault of raw power and intensity. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

6. "Pushit" - 'Ænima' (1996)
“Remember I will always love you, as I claw your fucking throat away” is, without question, one of the most powerful lyrics ever written. One of the deeper offerings from Tool’s collection, “Pushit” tackles the subject of domestic violence long before #MeToo or #TimesUp ever existed. The song doesn’t only capture the ambivalence that victims of abusive partners often go through—torn between the idea of love and the reality of their dangerous situation—but it also reflects on the way abusers can gaslight their victims into believing that they do love them, despite the physical harm they inflict. This song is raw, haunting and real, proving that Maynard has always been a forward-thinking man ahead of the times. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

5. "Third Eye" - 'Ænima' (1996)
“Third Eye” cold opens with a quippy, yet brilliantly accurate, quote from late comedian Bill Hicks, which essentially breaks down the secret behind good artistry: drugs. Hicks was a free-thinker and much like Maynard’s buddy Joe Rogan, he endorsed the use of psychedelics for mind altering enlightenment. As the music kicks in, it delivers a swirling and primal energy, eventually petering out only to peak back up again with an intense bridge. The song seems to portray the ebb and flow of a hallucinatory experience, really capturing the different layers of a trip. — KI
Zoo Entertainment

4. "Eulogy" - 'Ænima' (1996)
Who is this eulogy for? Rumors have mentioned everyone from Jesus to Kurt Cobain, and Danny Carey even once said the track was about L. Ron Hubbard. Whoever it’s about, it’s hard to deny that the track is an absolute masterpiece—and though it clocks in at over 8 minutes, the band fills every second with musical brilliance. — RL-B
Volcano Entertainment

3. "Parabol" / "Parabola" - 'Lateralus' (2001)
The overarching theme of ‘Lateralus’ is a quest for spirituality. “Parabola” and its calming preamble, “Parabol,” focus on the rebirth of oneself during a period of enlightenment. The lyrics are told from the perspective of someone who recognizes that our bodies are merely the physical vessel that harnesses our soul. And much like the stages of a spirit quest, “Parabol” starts out slow and minimalistic, setting up the roaring apex that is “Parabola.” — KI
Zoo Entertainment

2. "Ænima" - 'Ænima' (1996)
Inspired by Bill Hicks’ legendary comedy bit on Los Angeles breaking off from the U.S. and floating into the Pacific Ocean, Tool penned an iconic hate anthem to L.A. with “Ænema.” The song is one of Tool’s angriest tracks, though presented through finesse and tranquility. Still, Maynard decimates Scientology, gangster wannabes, junkies, actresses and more in the song’s iconic fourth verse. — GH
Volcano Entertainment

1. "Lateralus" - 'Lateralus' (2001)
There are two things that will always be the same in every language: music and math. “Lateralus” is a brilliant and mathematical work of music that is cleverly engineered after the Fibonacci sequence, making for some unfathomably intriguing time signatures and lyrical patterns. And much like the spiral model of the Fibonacci sequence, “Lateralus” is a spiraling crescendo of trippy peaks and valleys that take the listener on an intense whirlwind of an artistic journey. If there is a quintessential Tool song that truly embodies the band’s collective creative abilities and musicianship, this is the one. — KI
