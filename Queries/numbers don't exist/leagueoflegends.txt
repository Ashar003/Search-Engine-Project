Prove that numbers are real

Show me the number 3

And before you think of holding up 3 fingers, that is not showing the existence of 3, that's just showing the existence of your fingers

numbers are not physical things that exist

they are concepts used to quantify things

If you don't think numbers are real, I'll trade you 3 of my dollars for 1,000 of yours. After all, it would be all the same to you, right?

But how can you tell the difference between the amounts without numbers?

I use the effect of gravity to tell the difference

The title screams conspiracy theory that I could get a 5 year old to create.

The rest of the post looks like something Jadan Smith would have posted on Twitter.
