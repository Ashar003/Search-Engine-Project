List of Common Reasons for Segmentation Faults in C/C++
CC++Server Side ProgrammingProgramming
The main reason for segmentation fault is accessing memory that is either not initialized, out of bounds for your program or trying to modify string literals. These may cause a segmentation fault though it is not guaranteed that they will cause a segmentation fault. Here are some of the common reasons for segmentation faults:

Accessing an array out of bounds
Dereferencing NULL pointers
Dereferencing freed memory
Dereferencing uninitialized pointers
Incorrect use of the "&" (address of) and "*" (dereferencing) operators
Improper formatting specifiers in printf and scanf statements
Stack overflow
Writing to read-only memory
