You’ll learn how to play acoustic guitar a lot faster if you put great ‘fundamentals’ in place. And the most important thing of all is posture.

Posture (AKA ‘how you hold the guitar’) isn’t the most sexy subject in the world but it is the most important. Nothing will influence your chances of successfully learning guitar more than your posture.

If there are errors in your posture you will never learn how to play acoustic guitar as well as you’d like.

How to have perfect guitar posture
Ok, this is super important: The Thing You Sit On is vital.


1) Don’t slump down into a low sofa
how to play acoustic guitar
This restricts your movement and makes playing guitar very difficult. (Especially if you’re using a large bodied dreadnought or jumbo acoustic.)

You shouldn’t have to reach OVER the guitar to play it.

2) Don’t sit in a chair with arms
Again, this restricts your movement and encourages you to keep your left elbow tucked in to your torso, this is terrible for guitar playing!

If you want to learn how to play acoustic guitar correctly your left arm must be completely free of obstructions.

3) Don’t perch on a high stool
Low stools are perfect for guitar playing, but high stools are forbidden for guitar players! If you’ve tried playing at the breakfast counter you will probably have experienced this already…

Playing on a tall stool tends to make your thighs slope downwards and this means the guitar slips away from you while playing.

If you want to learn how to play acoustic guitar it’s a prerequisite that the instrument is secure.

4) So what’s the best ‘Thing To Sit On’?
Sit on anything you want, provided these two things are in place:

Your knees should be at a 90 degree angle or angled slightly towards you.
Both arms should be totally free from obstruction.
With these two things in place you can learn how to play acoustic guitar quicker and with less frustration.

How to Play Acoustic Guitar – Important Guitar Anatomy
You don’t need to know much about your guitar’s anatomy, but you do need to know a little. Here are the parts of the guitar that are ‘essential knowledge’:

 The ‘Fretboard’
how to play acoustic guitar
This is where you press your fingers to play different chords or notes. Learning how to play acoustic guitar is simpler than electric guitar because we don’t need to worry about amplification. We can focus purely on your right hand and left hand technique.

The ‘Bridge’
how to play acoustic guitar
This is where the strings are held in place. On an acoustic guitar the strings are usually fixed into the bridge using small pegs.

The ‘Machine Heads’
how to play acoustic guitar
Inside the red box above you will see the guitar’s ‘headstock’. You’ll also see some keys that can be turned. We call these ‘machine heads’ and they raise and lower the pitch of each string. Adjusting these is how you keep your guitar in tune.

If you want to learn how to play acoustic guitar you must know how to keep the instrument in tune, so the machine heads are a vital piece of your guitar’s anatomy.

What are the note of the guitar strings?
how to play acoustic guitar for beginners
You’ll find it almost impossible to learn how to play acoustic guitar if you don’t know the notes of the strings. In standard tuning the strings have a name AND a number.

The thickest string is called the 6th string. In standard guitar tuning, this is tuned to E. We often refer to this as the ‘low E string‘. This is the deepest/lowest guitar note you can play.
The 5th string is tuned to A, so it’s usually referred to as the A string.
The 4th string is tuned to D, so it’s usually referred to as the D string.
The 3rd string is tuned to G, so it’s usually referred to as the G string.
The 2nd string is tuned to B, so it’s usually referred to as the B string.
The 1st string is tuned to E. This is the thinnest of all the strings. We often refer to this as the ‘high E string’.

How to remember the string names/notes
The easiest way to remember the string names is by using a mnemonic.

Try this one:

Elephants
And
Donkeys
Grow
Big
Ears
This next one is my favourite:

Eddie
Ate
Dynaminte
Good

What’s the difference between chords and notes?
A note is a solitary pitch. It’s what you hear when you pluck one string.
A chord is a group of notes played together at the same time.
Think of it like this: Notes are like letters. Chords are like words.

For example, here is a G Chord…
G_major

…And here is a G Note…
learn how to play acoustic guitar
There are a lot of guitar notes on the fretboard and it can be really overwhelming for a beginner. All beginners should focus solely on CHORDS. Don’t try and understand all the notes of the fretboard as a beginner – that’s a frustrating and unhelpful path to take.

What are ‘chords’?
If you want to learn how to play acoustic guitar you must understand chords. A chord is a group of notes played together at the same time. 

For example, if you strum the G, B and E string, you play a chord. (Because you’re strumming a ‘group’ of notes at the same time.)

‘Should I focus on notes or chords?’
They’re both awesome. But chords are more suitable for beginners. If you want to learn how to play acoustic guitar easily then definitely start with chords.

How to fret chords correctly
Make sure you use the very TIPS of your fingers. You don’t want to use the fleshy part, where your fingerprints are.

Using the tips of your fingers allows the maximum space in between each string. This mean notes can ring clearly without being muffled or deadened by unwanted fingers.

Try playing some simple chords with your finger tips vs your fingerprints. You will quickly see which one sounds best!

how to play acoustic guitar
Each note needs to be clear and clean.
Make sure to place your finger in the middle of the frets, not ON the frets. Your finger needs to go in the gap. This helps stop deadened notes and is a crucial part of learning how to play acoustic guitar in a clean and articulate way.
how to play acoustic guitar
For the vast majority of chords your thumb should be in the middle of the neck and pointing to the ceiling.

How to strum a guitar
Chords are important, but strumming is how we make music. This is where everything comes to life!

One of the key things in learning how to play acoustic guitar is developing a strong and rhythmic strum. Unlike electric guitarists, you can’t hide behind effects or a distorted amp. Your strumming has to be on point.

‘Should I use a pick to strum?’
Learning how to play acoustic guitar is easier with a pick. It feels weird to begin with, but that only last for a few hours.

After tens of thousands of hours of teaching guitar I learned that, overall, people learn guitar faster if they play with a pick.

Play with your fingers too, by all means, but don’t do it at the expense of using a pick.
Never, EVER, strum with your thumb. This is an incredibly limiting habit which will stunt your progress as a guitarist.
The correct way to hold a pick
1 – Do a thumbs up sign:

how to play acoustic guitar
2 – Place your pick on the top of your index finger, with the pointy edge facing you

how to play acoustic guitar for beginners
3 – Bring your thumb down

That’s how you hold a pick. This takes EVERYONE a while to get used to, so don’t worry if it feels foreign or awkward to begin with.

How to strum an acoustic guitar
Strumming can be difficult when we first start, but it’s essential you master it if you want to learn how to play acoustic guitar. This is how we bring music to life.

When you strum, you want to have a nice swinging motion from your elbow and just a little wrist movement. 90% of the strum comes from your elbow.
Make sure your wrist is nice and straight and not angled inwards like a swan neck.
How To Strum Acoustic Guitar
This is what it should look like from your perspective when you strum:

Timing Tips
If you don’t keep in time you will find it hard to play along to songs and with other people. This is important.

Most of the time when we strum chords, we want each strum to be even. So the gaps between each strum are the same.

You don’t want to have uneven gaps as this often causes you to go OUT of time.

Here I’ve strummed a chord four times.

Audio Player

Can you hear how each one has the same amount of time between each one?

Feeling the tempo
When we listen to music we often hear a ‘pulse’, this is the beat.

We notice this when we tap along to a piece of music, we feel the music and instantly know whether it’s fast, slow or medium paced.

In this audio clip Jack talks about how to establish tempo:

Audio Player

00:00
00:00

Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.
.

Once we’ve established the beat we can use it to help our strumming technique.

The vast majority of popular music is in 4/4 time. This means there are four beats per bar of music. Don’t worry too much about what this means – as a beginner all you need to know is that you should count 1, 2, 3, 4 repeatedly!

So because our beats go 1, 2, 3, 4…. We strum downwards on each beat.

That should sound like this..

Audio Player

00:00
00:00

Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.
.

This sounds ok because it’s in time. But it doesn’t sound very fluid. This is where upstrokes arrive.
We need to add some upstrokes in too. We add these in-between the beats.

So instead of just strumming, 1, 2, 3, 4.

We strum: 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and, etc…

(On the “and” you should use an up stroke.)

If you want to learn how to play acoustic guitar this is a critical point, so forgive me for labouring it. This needs to be clear! 🙂

strumming an acoustic guitar
Here’s what the pattern should sound like.

Can you hear the downstrokes ON the beat and the upstrokes IN-BETWEEN the beat?

Let’s take it to the next level…
The final strumming pattern we can do here is simply double the speed of our last one.

This is slightly harder to play but gives us a relentless fluidity which sounds great in acoustic & folk-based tracks. Check out this song by Amy McDonald and listen to the acoustic guitar to get a flavour of this:

This style of strumming fun to play and sounds awesome. If we refer back to our ongoing example, it would sound something like this:
