Common Guitar Myths and Misconceptions
There are many misconceptions about learning how to play the guitar, many of which have hindered individuals from picking up an instrument they’ve always dreamed about playing.

After years in the industry, we’ve heard plenty of reasons that people put off learning to play the guitar. Here are some of the most common guitar myths and misconceptions:

“I’m too old to learn an instrument!”
“I don’t have the time to learn to play the guitar.”
“Physical limitations will get in the way of my ability to play the guitar.”
“I can’t play the guitar left handed.”

Buying A Guitar For Beginners

First things, first. Before you begin your journey of learning the guitar, you’ll need the instrument! While much of your decision will be based on personal preference, there are some key factors to consider when buying a guitar as a beginner guitarist:

Price
Style
Player Age/Size
Guitar Condition
Where You’re Purchasing
Where to Purchase
As a beginner, it is best to avoid making a pawn shop, flea market, or yard sale purchase unless you are shopping with somebody who has experience in purchasing a guitar. Having never purchased a guitar, you may not know what to look for in terms of damage or guitar quality. With that being said, a local music retail shop is your best bet. You may also shop online with a reputable company, although be sure to review the business’ return policy.

Price of Guitar
While some suggest that a great guitar can cost you between $300 and $500, there are plenty of quality guitars available within the $100 to $200 range. Additionally, there are many “package” options that include not only the guitar, but also essential accessories, such as a tuner and gig bag

Electric vs Acoustic vs Classical Guitar
Though this decision can be based on preference, we think the best guitar for a beginner is the acoustic guitar. Classical guitars have a wider neck, which can be hard for younger students or physically smaller individuals to handle when learning guitar chords. Meanwhile, the electric guitar is designed to be played with an amplifier, which comes at an additional cost. Acoustic guitars are simple and require little to no additional equipment, making them ideal for beginner guitarists.

Condition of Guitar
There are numerous things to look for when purchasing a guitar. If purchasing a brand new guitar, these issues likely won’t be a concern, but they are worth checking for. Here are some steps to follow as you check the condition of a guitar:


1.) Slowly run your hand up and down the length of the guitar’s neck, as pictured below. It should be smooth, with no sharp edges or splinters.

2.) Turn the guitar over and check its heel, as indicated in the photo below. There should be no cracks or gaps between the guitar’s heel and neck.

3.) On the front of the guitar, check the bridge, as pictured below. Run a thin pick between the bridge and the body of the guitar to ensure there are no gaps.

4.) Check the guitar’s string height by pressing down on the first, second, and third fret. You should be able to do so with minimal effort. Come to the 12th fret and press down. The distance from the top of fret to the bottom of the string should be no more than three times. If it is five times, the guitar may have a warped neck or too high of a bridge.
