Why Does My Hand Hurt?

De Quervain's Tendinitis
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Arthritis
Trigger Finger
Hand pain can happen for many reasons, from accidents to conditions that are ongoing. It can often be treated so that your symptoms ease up.

This article looks at some of the most common causes of hand pain.

 

De Quervain's Tendinitis
This is also called de Quervain's tendinosis. It causes pain on the thumb side of the wrist.

The pain may develop gradually or start suddenly. It can travel the length of the thumb and up the forearm.

If you have de Quervain's tendinitis, it can be painful to:

Make a fist
Grasp or hold objects
Turn your wrist
The pain results from irritation or inflammation of the wrist tendons at the base of the thumb. Repetitive activities and overuse are often responsible for de Quervain's.

New mothers can get it from holding their baby in an awkward position. Wrist fractures can also make you more likely to get de Quervain's.

Pain relief treatments include:

A splint to rest the thumb and wrist
Anti-inflammatory medications
Cortisone shots

Surgery may be an option if symptoms remain severe after you have tried other treatments.

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
This is one of the most common nerve disorders of the hand. It causes pain in the:

Palm and some fingers of the hand
Wrist
Forearm
Often the pain is worse at night than during the day. Carpal tunnel syndrome can also cause:

Weakness
Tingling
Numbness
You may especially feel it in your thumb, index finger, and middle finger. This can make it hard to grip objects.


The discomfort happens when swelling constricts the median nerve. The median nerve controls sensation and muscle impulses in the thumb and most of the fingers (except for the pinkie finger and the half of the ring finger that’s closest to the pinkie finger).

The median nerve passes through the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is a structure made up of bones and connective tissues that is located at the base of the hand. It is in this narrow space that the median nerve is pinched by inflamed or irritated tendons or other swelling.

Common treatments include:

Resting the hand and wrist
Anti-inflammatory or analgesic painkillers
Wrist splints
Steroid shots
Physical therapy
Your doctor may suggest surgery if your symptoms last for 6 months or more.
