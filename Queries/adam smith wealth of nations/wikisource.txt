Sister Projects.sister projects: Wikipedia article, Commons category, Wikidata item.
An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations is the magnum opus of this Scottish economist. It is a clearly written account of political economy at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, and is widely (if perhaps incorrectly) considered to be the first modern work in the field of economics. The work is also the first comprehensive defence of free markets.
