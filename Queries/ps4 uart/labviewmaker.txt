UART Open

Open the UART channel with the specified baud rate. If the LINX device has a single UART it is channel 0. If the LINX device has more than one UART the logical first UART is channel 0, the next is channel 1, etc.

For example on myRIO: A/UART maps to LINX UART Channel 0 B/UART maps to LINX UART Channel 1


Inputs
LINX Resource
Contains LINX connection resources.

UART Channel (0)
Specifies the UART channel to open.

Baud Rate (9600)
Specifies the UART baud rate to use.

Error In
Describes error conditions that occur before this node runs. This input provides standard error in functionality.

Outputs
LINX Resource
Contains LINX connection resources.

Actual Baud
Returns the actual baud rate used (supported baud rates vary between LINX devices).

Error Out
Contains error information. This output provides standard error out functionality.
