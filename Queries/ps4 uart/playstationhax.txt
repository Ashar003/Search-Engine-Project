Tools you would need

A set of screw Drivers to open up the PS4
Soldering station $30-$150 (depends what you get)
Solder 0.7mm - $7
Flux - $5 - $15
Kynair Wire- $7
Wire cutters - $12
(Optional) Hot Glue and Glue gun - $15
Tip cleaner - $10
ANY Cheap  FTDI USB to TTL Serial Adapter
Micro-USB Cable
etc

First

After you have your tools buy any cheap FTDI USB to TTL Serial Adapter

Step 4

MAKE SURE THE WIRES ARE STICKING OUT of the console

(Optional) Hot glue the wires to the motherboard so they dont come un-done when you put the PS4 back togather

Step 5

Put the console back together WITH THE WIRES HANGING OUT

Step 6

Solder the ground wire to Ground on the device and the TX Wire from the PS4 to the RX Pad on the FTDI Device (Pic of the one i bought0
