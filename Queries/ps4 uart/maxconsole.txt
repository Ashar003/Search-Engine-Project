You can find attached below ready to download directly. I have a feeling this will lead to something big, respect and thanks for sharing. xorloser also posted the flash pins used by the first PS4 modchip MTX Key:"
MTX install points:
CS
SCLK
SI
SO
VCC (3V)
GND
As my friend @modrobert from EurAsia points out above, this could lead to something 'big', we already seen the MTX Key chip, the china clone E3 Share from E3-Tech, and even tho Sony blocked the early versions with v4.72, I think we will soon seen better ones!
