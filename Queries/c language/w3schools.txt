Still, the best programming language to learn quickly.
C language is reliable, simple, and easy to use.
C language is a structured language.
Modern programming concepts are based on C.
It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.
Universities preferred to add C programming in their courseware.
C is a robust language with a rich set of built-in functions and operators.
Programs written in C are efficient and fast.
C is highly portable; programs once written in C can be run on other machines with minor or no modification.
C is a collection of C library functions; we can also create our function and add it to the C library.
C is easily extensible.
C is the building block for many other programming languages.
Programs written in C are highly portable.
Several standard functions are there (like in-built) that can be used to develop programs.
C programs are collections of C library functions, and it's also easy to add functions to the C library.
The modular structure makes code debugging, maintenance, and testing easier.
