Leaked PlayStation 5 dev kit photo sets tongues wagging
Dual shock.

A photograph of the PlayStation 5 development kit has hit the internet.

The image, published to Twitter by user @Alcoholikaust, shows two PS5 dev kits side by side.

The Verge's Tom Warren has commented to verify the photo does indeed shows PS5 dev kits, and their unusual V-shaped design tallies with previous leaked images, Sony's own patented designs, as well as a description from Wired, which saw the dev kits in the flesh while reporting for an article on the PS5.

@tomwarren
yes, this is the PlayStation 5 devkit. The reason it's large and v-shaped is to make them more easily stackable for devs who are running multiple stress tests. The cooling is optimized to push air out of the sides and center https://twitter.com/Alcoholikaust/status/1200796076535623681 …

There is no suggestion the PS5 dev kit reflects the final design of the retail console, which is due out in time for Christmas 2020. Typically, dev kits look nothing like their equivalent launch products.

The photo tallies with images from a Sony patent.
So, what does the picture tell us? Not much. Some have suggested the DualShock controller in the image is the new DualShock 5, based on information gleaned from an official Sony patent. Others have tried to make out the text on the front of the consoles, but the image is too blurry to provide anything definitive.

For context, PS4 and PS4 Pro dev kits are behind the PS5 dev kits in the photo.

Where did the image come from? Here's @Alcoholikaust:

Developer. The devkits have been out there a while this particular developer just didn’t give a fuck apparently.
