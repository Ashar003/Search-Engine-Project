SQUATS: WHAT PROPER SQUATS LOOK LIKE & WHICH MUSCLES THEY WORK

Learn more about the Squat exercise and how to Squat properly so you don’t miss out on key benefits of your workout program.

Most of us find it hard to do Squats without making at least one big mistake. This is mainly due to our sedentary lifestyle.

Proper squats…

Strengthen your legs, glutes, and many other muscles
Improve your lower body mobility
Keep your bones and joints healthy
“Bad” squats…

Don’t activate the right muscles at the proper intensity
Put additional stress on ligaments and joints
Increase risk of injury
Don’t worry, by the end of this article you’ll know exactly how to do a squat properly and you’ll never skip leg day again. You’ll also learn tips that will help you avoid squat mistakes and correct your squat form.

THE SQUAT
The Squat is a lower body exercise. You can do the bodyweight version, without added resistance (also called Bodyweight Squat or Air Squat), or with weights such as a barbell (Front Squat and Back Squat are variations of the Barbell Squat).

The Squat exercise mainly targets the thighs (quadriceps & hamstrings) and the glutes. However, core strength & stability, ankle mobility, back muscles, calves, and other factors play an important role when you are doing this exercise.

SET UP BEFORE YOU SQUAT:
Find a foot stance that feels best for you. Pointing your toes slightly outwards helps some, but keeping them parallel is fine, too. If you’re not sure what’s best, start by putting your feet shoulder-width apart and pointed about 15 degrees outwards.
Tense your abs like someone is about to punch you.
Look straight ahead and stand tall!
Mistake #1 – Starting from the knees
Mistake #2 – Letting your knees go inward
Mistake #3 – Hunching your back
Mistake #4 – Lifting your heels off the floor
Squats are the foundation of many workout programs. Hopefully you feel much more confident about doing them now.

Don’t forget to switch it up, try some squat variations as well.

TAKEAWAY

Check your form:

“Sit back” – make sure to move your butt backward, don’t just bend your knees
Be careful to keep your knees in line with your toes, don’t let them cave in
Don’t forget about your upper body – look straight ahead and don’t round your back
Most importantly – explore the movement…

Try to notice what feels different when you change something like your foot stance or the position of your knees…
Experiment with tips and don’t hesitate to use assistance (such as a door frame for upper body support) if you need it
It takes a lot of practice to become more aware of how you move, but it’s worth it
If you experience difficulties performing a proper squat – take your time to work on mobility and practice, practice… it will pay off. It may seem boring to focus on your weakness, but remember – weakness is where your biggest potential lies!
