What is the "stack smashing detected" error?
stack smashing
errors
Usually, the compiler generates the stack smashing detected error in response to its defense mechanism against buffer overflows.

A buffer​ overflow occurs when the user input exceeds the buffer capacity. The following C code can cause the buffer to overflow if the user enters more than ten characters. In such a ​case, the compiler will throw the stack smashing detected error.

#include<stdio.h>
void get_name(){
  char buffer[10];
  gets(buffer);
}
int main() {
    printf("Please enter your name.");
    get_name();
    return 0;
}

Using canaries
A buffer overflow is dangerous, so the compiler uses various protection mechanisms to guard against it. One such mechanism is a canary. A canary is a randomly generated value, ​and in the case of a buffer overflow, the canary is overwritten; when, upon comparison with the known value, the compiler detects that the stack was compromised it throws the stack smashing detected error.

The following demonstrates how canaries are used:
